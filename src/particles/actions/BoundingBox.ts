/**
 * The BoundingBox action confines each particle to a rectangle region. The 
 * particle bounces back off the sides of the rectangle when it reaches 
 * the edge. The bounce treats the particle as a circular body. By default,
 * no energy is lost in the collision. This can be modified by setting the
 * bounce property to a value other than 1, its default value.
 * 
 * This action has a priority of -20, so that it executes after 
 * all movement has occured.
